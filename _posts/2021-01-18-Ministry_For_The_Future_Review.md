Ministry for the Future by Kim Stanley Robinson is the best novel about climate change out there. This is partially because of the clearly massive amount of research that went into it and the real believability of the solutions and events that occur throughout the book. However, the real reason why this book is so damn good is because it gets at the visceral, real, and brutal consequences of climate change better than any study or opinion piece ever could and any other fiction I've read on the subject has.  

The novel opens with Frank May, a volunteer medical worker from the U.S. working in India, surviving a heat wave that kills twenty million people. Page _twelve_ has descriptions like  

> "all the old people were dead. People murmured what should have been screams of grief; those who could still move shoved bodies out of the lake, or out toowards the middle where they floated like logs, or sank,"  

The true human cost of climate change being made clear from the start, and becoming the spark for much of the events of thet rest of the book, forces you to *get it*
