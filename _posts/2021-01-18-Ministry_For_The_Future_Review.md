<h2>The Story Itself</h2>
Ministry for the Future by Kim Stanley Robinson is the best novel about climate change out there. This is partially because of the clearly massive amount of research that went into it and the real believability of the solutions and events that occur throughout the book. However, the real reason why this book is so damn good is because it gets at the visceral, real, and brutal consequences of climate change better than any study or opinion piece ever could and any other fiction I've read on the subject has.  

The novel opens with Frank May, a volunteer medical worker from the U.S. working in India, surviving a heat wave that kills twenty million people. Page _twelve_ has descriptions like  

> "all the old people were dead. People murmured what should have been screams of grief; those who could still move shoved bodies out of the lake, or out toowards the middle where they floated like logs, or sank,"  

The true human cost of climate change being made clear from the start, and becoming the spark for much of the events of thet rest of the book, forces you to **get it**â€”to understand how truly fucked up even the first effects of climate change are going to be and how almost _anything_ is justified to stop and reverse the process. Robinson makes sure this almost personal understanding of the consequences of climate change remains with you through a character who spends, by the end of the book, twenty eight years of their life in climate refugee camps or in transit between them. With climate change caused suffering on a scale surpassing at leastt WWI and maybe WWII, the destruction of a couple hundred plane flights in mid-air by drones thereby ending all public air travel, and similar actions done to cargo ships, becomes something you feel relieved, rather than horrified, by. Then you think about that relief and realize "If it's going to get so bad that an onlooker could cheer eco-terrorism, we really have to do everything to stop and try reverse this RIGHT NOW."  

Of course, in The Ministry for the Future ecoterrorism alone isn't enough. And it won't be enough(and ideally it won't be anything) in our world. That's where the titular ministry comes into play. The ministry's cajoling and pleading with national governments, their good-enough solutions, their attempts(some succsesful) at establishing their own initiatives, all feel incredibly real and are incredibly well researched.  

Another thing that Robinson does that makes his vision of a potential future feel so complete is the diversity of solutions being practiced by different groups, from India geo-engineering the equivalent of a volcanically induced cooling to prevent climate-holocaust, the various agricultural solutions proposed by conservationists, technological solutions funded by billionaires in Silicon Valley with spare money, laws from governments, and more.

An in depth review of the even greater list of specific solutions practiced by these groups and my own (uninformed) perspective on how well they'd work isn't in the purview of this review, but they include recreating all social media to be peer-to-peer and with personal data as a thing to be sold or withheld by the person themselves, national reserves working together to maintain a carbon-coin based off of Keynes' [Bancor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bancor) to incentivize divestment, agricultural reforms, conservationists starting a movement to give half of Earth back to non-humans by creating and widening wildlife corridors, zeppelins, Photovoltaic sail-boats, coloring the arctic sea yellow to increase its albedo, reforestation, carbon capture into old oil wells, pumping water out from under glaciers to slow them down, and much more. The point is that the variety of solutions is so wide, their interactions and consequences so complex, that two things happen. The first is that you accept the broad stroke of all of them taken together. The story is believable. Or at least you aren't smart or knowledgable enough to refute every point sufficiently so just shut up and enjoy the ride.  

The second, and much more important thing that happens is that you start to feel kind of optimistic. It's not all doom and gloom and twenty million dead in one day. It's hope! There are **SO MANY SOLUTIONS**(blog post about that in the works, needed to be updated partially because of this book). If we keep throwing things at the wall to see what sticks, what saves us, it will be worth it. The book doesn't end on a safe or comfortable note. There is still so much left to do, and some things, like ocean acidification, is irreversable but things have gotten better, there's more hope than ever before. PPM of CO2 in the air is going down, animals are coming back, and inequality has shrunk more than it ever has before.  

The book is a message to keep fighting because we have to fight and we can win.
