A list of books that I've read and reccomend and why:  

|Books|Author|Reasoning|
|---|---|---|
|_Too Like the Lightning_, Terra Ignota series|Ada Palmer|Best science fiction in at least two decades, well written and incredibly innovative world that explores power, gender, historiography, societal arrangements, choice, theology, everything really. I don't think I can reccomend this series enough. If you find anything interesting at all, read it.|
|_Hyperion_, Hyperion Cantos|Dan Simmons|The first book is a multi-thematic canterbury tales in space dealing with war, love, sacrifice, god, and pain. The fourth and final book in the cantos is one of my favorite books of all time and is the most important anarcho-transhumanist text I have ever read. It also contains the powerful but hard to apply life philosophy I know of|
|_Parable of the Sower_, Earthseed series|Octavia Butler|Rounding out the three greatest science fiction series of the past thirty years, this series' themes are empathy and change. These ideas are combined in the crucible of global warming, crisis, pain, and America to form a path to the stars built on empathy, strength, and the courage to embrace and shape change. Change is god|
